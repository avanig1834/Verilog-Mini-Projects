# DATAPATH REPRESENTATION
In complex digital systems, the whole hardware is typically partitioned into two parts: **DATA-PATH** and **CONTROL-PATH**.
## DATA PATH 
A datapath in digital design is the hardware component responsible for processing and transferring data within a system. It consists of registers, multiplexers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and buses, enabling computation and data movement. It is commonly used in processors, ALUs, and signal processing applications. 
## CONTROL PATH
It is a finite state machine (FSM) which will be generating or providing some control signals for the data path in a particular sequence. And by doing that the data path will get activated accordingly and the operations will be carried out as per the intended requirement. The control path can also take some input from the data path okay to get information of status of the process.
