# FIFO - BUFFER
A FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer is a type of queue used in digital circuits to temporarily store data before processing. It follows the FIFO principle, meaning the first data written into the buffer is the first to be read out.
A 32 x 8 fifo buffer is implemented using verilog. It is a 2D array of 32 bit word size each 8 bits long.
